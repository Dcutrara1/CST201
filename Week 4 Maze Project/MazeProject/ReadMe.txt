Assignment: Maze 4 Project

I have completed my Individual Assignment 1 Project in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio. My project uses a vector and a Queue to solve the maze. I replaced the stack with a Queue and then used the same coding just by adding .back() to find the last item added to the queue in order to pop the correct value.   

My project is loaded on github:
